What to include;
- Ask the question why you aren't tagging.
- Best practice?
- Using development versions
- Branch aliases

> The solution really is education, and I will try to help a bit by pushing for best practices in composer docs. Not everyone has much experience with package management and many people don't realize how problematic this approach can be (until it's too late), so it's everyone's job to help by reminding them.
