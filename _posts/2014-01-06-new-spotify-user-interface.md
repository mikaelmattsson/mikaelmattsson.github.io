As many probably already have read, [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) has started to roll out an updated look to their desktop app. The update includes a darker user interface that make musicians artwork pop out.

Most of the updates appears to be purley cosmetic, though there seems to be some tiny new features available. For example, in artist pages there is a new plus button on each track. If you press it, Spotify creates a new playlist called *Recently Saved* and adds the track to it.

For those who couldn't wait till Spotify acutally released the update to everyone, like myself, tried everything to get it. I've heard users tried to log-in-out and reinstalling the app, in this way checking if they had gotten the update. Though, it seemed as Spotify only released it to a few users.

This week I've found this blog post by [Javier Santos](http://www.javiersantos.me) were he wrote about installing the new version. He provides a downloadable version (0.9.8) for both [Mac](https://mega.co.nz/#!RtRy0R6a!UIEO3ldFr_AxSYKc34f2vUWZR-EX-dF_SDcRZbKqWHs) and [Windows](https://mega.co.nz/#!gxJiwb5L!N2pq4EimGa8evV2SQz-cIGfJFa9AIzpnGMJCDzF6SGw). Big thanks to him!

There is still no release notes in the [forums](http://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-Announcements/All-Spotify-Release-Notes/td-p/551574). Even till this day ({{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}) Spotify has yet to announce the new version.

Except for some minor design errors the app feels really stable and runs smoothly. Keep up the good work Spotify!
