Whenever I fail to write a URL correctly in Google Chrome the auto-complete will punish me for a long time. Today I've learned how to remove entries from the auto-completion list.

## Linux & Windows

Just highlight the entry you wont to remove in the drop-down list (using the arrow keys, or your mouse cursor) and press `delete` on your keyboard.

## Mac

For mac users this is a little more tricky. First start by typing the unwanted auto-completed URL until it shows itself.  

Then hit `fn` + `shift` + `delete` if you have a compact keyboard or `shift` + `delete`  if you have a keyboard with separate `delete` key (and no `fn`).  If you have a non-Apple keyboard, `shift` + `delete` should do the trick.


In my case, I had accidentally written `http://packagist.com` (which doesn't exist) instead of ending it with `org` in the end. It had bugged me for days and today I finally found a solution. Thanks for reading along!
